The Inventory Management System is structured around a MainWindow that facilitates user login and signup processes, leading to different user-specific windows such as Admin, Manager, and Employee Windows. These windows manage user and stock data, with functionalities like adding items, searching stocks, and refreshing lists, supported by classes like Search and AddItem. The system also includes a Dashboard for summarizing inventory statistics and generating reports.
